    Abstract = {We propose the use of Flat Metric to assess the performance of reconstruction
methods for single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in scenarios where
the ground-truth is available. Flat Metric is intimately related to the concept
of optimal transport between measures of different mass, providing solid
mathematical foundations for SMLM evaluation and integrating both localization
and detection performance. In this paper, we provide the foundations of Flat
Metric and validate this measure by applying it to controlled synthetic
examples and to data from the SMLM 2016 Challenge.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the two-node joint clock synchronization and ranging problem. We focus on the case of nodes that employ time-to-digital converters to determine the range between them precisely. This specific design choice leads to a sawtooth model for the captured signal, which has not been studied before from an estimation theoretic standpoint. In the study of this model, we recover the basic conclusion of a well-known article by Freris, Graham, and Kumar in clock synchronization. More importantly, we discover a surprising identifiability result on the sawtooth signal model: noise improves the theoretical condition of the estimation of the phase and offset parameters. To complete our study, we provide performance references for joint clock synchronization and ranging using the sawtooth signal model by presenting an exhaustive simulation study on basic estimation strategies under different realistic conditions. With our contributions in this paper, we enable further research in the estimation of sawtooth signal models and pave the path towards their industrial use for clock synchronization and ranging.},

  Abstract = {In this two-part paper, we present a novel framework and methodology to analyze data from certain image-based biochemical assays, e.g., ELISPOT and Fluorospot assays. In this first part, we start by presenting a physical partial differential equations (PDE) model up to image acquisition for these biochemical assays. Then, we use the PDEs' Green function to derive a novel parametrization of the acquired images. This parametrization allows us to propose a functional optimization problem to address inverse diffusion. In particular, we propose a non-negative group-sparsity regularized optimization problem with the goal of localizing and characterizing the biological cells involved in the said assays. We continue by proposing a suitable discretization scheme that enables both the generation of synthetic data and implementable algorithms to address inverse diffusion. We end Part I by providing a preliminary comparison between the results of our methodology and an expert human labeler on real data. Part II is devoted to providing an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve the proposed problem and to the empirical validation of our methodology.},

    Abstract = {Accurate cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISpot and FluoroSpot immunoassays is a challenging task. Methodology recently proposed by our group matches human accuracy by leveraging knowledge of the underlying physical process of these assays and using state-of-the-art iterative techniques to solve an inverse problem. Nonetheless, thousands of computationally expensive iterations are often needed to reach a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the iterations to design a parameterized computation graph, \emph{SpotNet}, that learns the characteristic patterns embedded within several training images and their respective cell secretion information. Further, we compare SpotNet to a customized convolutional neural network layout for cell detection based on recent advances. We show empirical evidence that, while both designs obtain a detection performance far beyond that of a human expert, SpotNet is substantially easier to train and obtains better estimates of cell secretion.},

The task has remained hard to automatize, and biomedical researchers often have to rely on results that are not accurate. Previously proposed solutions are heuristic, and data-based
	solutions are subject to a lack of objective ground truth data. In this paper, we analyze a partial differential equations model for ELISPOT, Fluorospot, and assays of similar design. This leads us to a mathematical observation model for the images generated by these assays. We use this model to motivate a methodology for cell detection. Finally, we provide a real-data example that suggests that this cell detection methodology and a human expert perform comparably.},

	Title = {Inverse problems in signal processing: {F}unctional optimization, parameter estimation and machine learning},
	Year = {2019},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-256079},
	Abstract = {Inverse problems arise in any scientific endeavor. Indeed, it is seldom the case that our senses or basic instruments, i.e., the data, provide the answer we seek. It is only by using our understanding of how the world has generated the data, i.e., a model, that we can hope to infer what the data imply. Solving an inverse problem is, simply put, using a model to retrieve the information we seek from the data. In signal processing, systems are engineered to generate, process, or transmit signals, i.e., indexed data, in order to achieve some goal. The goal of a specific system could be to use an observed signal and its model to solve an inverse problem. However, the goal could also be to generate a signal so that it reveals a parameter to investigation by inverse problems. Inverse problems and signal processing overlap substantially, and rely on the same set of concepts and tools. This thesis lies at the intersection between them, and presents results in modeling, optimization, statistics, machine learning, biomedical imaging and automatic control. The novel scientific content of this thesis is contained in its seven composing publications, which are reproduced in Part II. In five of these, which are mostly motivated by a biomedical imaging application, a set of related optimization and machine learning approaches to source localization under diffusion and convolutional coding models are presented. These are included in Publications A, B, E, F and G, which also include contributions to the modeling and simulation of a specific family of image-based immunoassays. Publication C presents the analysis of a system for clock synchronization between two nodes connected by a channel, which is a problem of utmost relevance in automatic control. The system exploits a specific node design to generate a signal that enables the estimation of the synchronization parameters. In the analysis, substantial contributions to the identifiability of sawtooth signal models under different conditions are made. Finally, Publication D brings to light and proves results that have been largely overlooked by the signal processing community and characterize the information that quantized linear models contain about their location and scale parameters.},

	Year = {2014},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-144032},
	Abstract = {For the time being, remote sensing automatized techniques are conventionally designed to be used exclusively on data captured by aparticular sensor system. This convention was only adopted after evidence suggested that, in the field, algorithms that yield great resultson data from one specific satellite or sensor, tend to underachieve on data from similar sensors. With this effect in mind, we will refer to remote sensing imagery as heterogeneous.There have been attempts to compensate every effect on the data and obtain the underlying physical property that carries the information, the ground reflectance. Because of their improvement of the informative value of each image, some of them have even been standardized as common preprocessing methods. However, these techniques generally require further knowledge on certain atmospheric properties at the time the data was captured. This information is generally not available and has to be estimated or guessed by experts, avery time consuming, inaccurate and expensive task. Moreover, even if the results do improve in each of the treated images, a significant decrease of their heterogeneity is not achieved. There have been more automatized proposals to treat the data in the literature, which have been broadly named relative radiometric normalization (RRN) algorithms. These consider the problem of heterogeneity itself and use properties strictly related to the statistics of remote sensing imagery to solve it. In this master thesis, an automatic algorithm to reduce heterogeneity in generic imagery is designed, characterized and evaluated through crossed classification results on remote sensing imagery.},
