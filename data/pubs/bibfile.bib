   Abstract = {We present a statistical framework to benchmark the performance of reconstruction algorithms for linear inverse problems, in particular, neural-network-based methods that require large quantities of training data. We generate synthetic signals as realizations of sparse stochastic processes, which makes them ideally matched to variational sparsity-promoting techniques. We derive Gibbs sampling schemes to compute the minimum mean-square error estimators for processes with Laplace, Student's t, and Bernoulli-Laplace innovations. These allow our framework to provide quantitative measures of the degree of optimality (in the mean-square-error sense) for any given reconstruction method. We showcase our framework by benchmarking the performance of some well-known variational methods and convolutional neural network architectures that perform direct nonlinear reconstructions in the context of deconvolution and Fourier sampling. Our experimental results support the understanding that, while these neural networks outperform the variational methods and achieve near-optimal results in many settings, their performance deteriorates severely for signals associated with heavy-tailed distributions.},

We review the known results for the topical variational regularization strategies (ℓ₂ and ℓ₁ regularization) and present novel stability results for ℓₚ-regularized linear inverse problems for p∈(1,∞). Our results guarantee Lipschitz continuity for small p and Hölder continuity for larger p. They generalize well to the Lₚ(Ω) function spaces.},

    Abstract = {A logconcave likelihood is as important to proper statistical inference as a convex cost function is important to variational optimization. Quantization is often disregarded when writing likelihood models, ignoring the limitations of the physical detectors used to collect the data. These two facts call for the question: would including quantization in likelihood models preclude logconcavity? are the true data likelihoods logconcave? We provide a general proof that the same simple assumption that leads to logconcave continuous-data likelihoods also leads to logconcave quantized-data likelihoods, provided that convex quantization regions are used.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the two-node joint clock synchronization and ranging problem. We focus on the case of nodes that employ time-to-digital converters to determine the range between them precisely. This specific design choice leads to a sawtooth model for the captured signal, which has not been studied before from an estimation theoretic standpoint. In the study of this model, we recover the basic conclusion of a well-known article by Freris, Graham, and Kumar in clock synchronization. More importantly, we discover a surprising identifiability result on the sawtooth signal model: noise improves the theoretical condition of the estimation of the phase and offset parameters. To complete our study, we provide performance references for joint clock synchronization and ranging using the sawtooth signal model by presenting an exhaustive simulation study on basic estimation strategies under different realistic conditions. With our contributions in this paper, we enable further research in the estimation of sawtooth signal models and pave the path towards their industrial use for clock synchronization and ranging.},

  Abstract = {In this two-part paper, we present a novel framework and methodology to analyze data from certain image-based biochemical assays, e.g., ELISPOT and Fluorospot assays. In this first part, we start by presenting a physical partial differential equations (PDE) model up to image acquisition for these biochemical assays. Then, we use the PDEs' Green function to derive a novel parametrization of the acquired images. This parametrization allows us to propose a functional optimization problem to address inverse diffusion. In particular, we propose a non-negative group-sparsity regularized optimization problem with the goal of localizing and characterizing the biological cells involved in the said assays. We continue by proposing a suitable discretization scheme that enables both the generation of synthetic data and implementable algorithms to address inverse diffusion. We end Part I by providing a preliminary comparison between the results of our methodology and an expert human labeler on real data. Part II is devoted to providing an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve the proposed problem and to the empirical validation of our methodology.},

   Abstract = {Superresolution T2-weighted fetal-brain magnetic-resonance imaging (FBMRI) traditionally relies on the availability of several orthogonal low-resolution series of 2-dimensional thick slices (volumes). In practice, only a few low-resolution volumes are acquired. Thus, optimization-based image-reconstruction methods require strong regularization using hand-crafted regularizers (e.g., TV). Yet, due to in utero fetal motion and the rapidly changing fetal brain anatomy, the acquisition of the high-resolution images that are required to train supervised learning methods is difficult. In this paper, we sidestep this difficulty by providing a proof of concept of a self-supervised single-volume superresolution framework for T2-weighted FBMRI (SAIR). We validate SAIR quantitatively in a motion-free simulated environment. Our results for different noise levels and resolution ratios suggest that SAIR is comparable to multiple-volume superresolution reconstruction methods. We also evaluate SAIR qualitatively on clinical FBMRI data. The results suggest SAIR could be incorporated into current reconstruction pipelines.},

   Abstract = {PET reconstruction algorithms have long relied on sinogram rebinning. However, as detectors grow smaller in a recent wave of cutting-edge scanners, individual sensors no longer accrue hundreds of photons. Instead, most detect a single photon or none at all, effectively
        turning sinogram data into point-cloud measurements. The highly heterogeneous sensitivity of these scanners is another issue. We approach sinogram rebinning in the face of these challenges with a density-estimation framework that promotes knot sparsity in an underlying spline basis.},

Methodology recently proposed by our group matches human accuracy by leveraging knowledge of the underlying physical process of these assays and using state-of-the-art iterative techniques to solve an inverse problem. Nonetheless, thousands of computationally expensive iterations are often needed to reach a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the iterations to design a parameterized computation graph, \emph{SpotNet}, that learns the characteristic patterns embedded within several training images and their respective cell secretion information. Further, we compare SpotNet to a customized convolutional neural network layout for cell detection based on recent advances. We show empirical evidence that, while both designs obtain a detection performance far beyond that of a human expert, SpotNet is substantially easier to train and obtains better estimates of cell secretion.},

	Title = {Inverse problems in signal processing: {F}unctional optimization, parameter estimation and machine learning},
	Year = {2019},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-256079},
	Abstract = {Inverse problems arise in any scientific endeavor. Indeed, it is seldom the case that our senses or basic instruments, i.e., the data, provide the answer we seek. It is only by using our understanding of how the world has generated the data, i.e., a model, that we can hope to infer what the data imply. Solving an inverse problem is, simply put, using a model to retrieve the information we seek from the data. In signal processing, systems are engineered to generate, process, or transmit signals, i.e., indexed data, in order to achieve some goal. The goal of a specific system could be to use an observed signal and its model to solve an inverse problem. However, the goal could also be to generate a signal so that it reveals a parameter to investigation by inverse problems. Inverse problems and signal processing overlap substantially, and rely on the same set of concepts and tools. This thesis lies at the intersection between them, and presents results in modeling, optimization, statistics, machine learning, biomedical imaging and automatic control. The novel scientific content of this thesis is contained in its seven composing publications, which are reproduced in Part II. In five of these, which are mostly motivated by a biomedical imaging application, a set of related optimization and machine learning approaches to source localization under diffusion and convolutional coding models are presented. These are included in Publications A, B, E, F and G, which also include contributions to the modeling and simulation of a specific family of image-based immunoassays. Publication C presents the analysis of a system for clock synchronization between two nodes connected by a channel, which is a problem of utmost relevance in automatic control. The system exploits a specific node design to generate a signal that enables the estimation of the synchronization parameters. In the analysis, substantial contributions to the identifiability of sawtooth signal models under different conditions are made. Finally, Publication D brings to light and proves results that have been largely overlooked by the signal processing community and characterize the information that quantized linear models contain about their location and scale parameters.},

	Year = {2014},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-144032},
	Abstract = {For the time being, remote sensing automatized techniques are conventionally designed to be used exclusively on data captured by aparticular sensor system. This convention was only adopted after evidence suggested that, in the field, algorithms that yield great resultson data from one specific satellite or sensor, tend to underachieve on data from similar sensors. With this effect in mind, we will refer to remote sensing imagery as heterogeneous.There have been attempts to compensate every effect on the data and obtain the underlying physical property that carries the information, the ground reflectance. Because of their improvement of the informative value of each image, some of them have even been standardized as common preprocessing methods. However, these techniques generally require further knowledge on certain atmospheric properties at the time the data was captured. This information is generally not available and has to be estimated or guessed by experts, avery time consuming, inaccurate and expensive task. Moreover, even if the results do improve in each of the treated images, a significant decrease of their heterogeneity is not achieved. There have been more automatized proposals to treat the data in the literature, which have been broadly named relative radiometric normalization (RRN) algorithms. These consider the problem of heterogeneity itself and use properties strictly related to the statistics of remote sensing imagery to solve it. In this master thesis, an automatic algorithm to reduce heterogeneity in generic imagery is designed, characterized and evaluated through crossed classification results on remote sensing imagery.},
