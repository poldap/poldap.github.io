	Abstract = {One of the most promising opportunities for scientists over the last years is the ease in the collection of data and its accessibility. Moreover, due to the proliferation of interdisciplinary fields, there has emerged the opportunity for data collaboration. For some years, though, organizations, companies, and institutions did not examine secure ways to manage, process, and share data. As a result, we can see nowadays the repercussions of these actions, as some of them are sufering the consequences with the social and legal risks caused by the exposure of their data records. In fact, the concern towards discovering secure ways of protecting data has escalated so rapidly over the last years that it took a great part of many of the discussions held at the World Economic Forum in January 2019. Motivated by this dire need for protecting data records, the first part of this project investigates successful ways of limiting the disclosure of private information held in a database when statistical information from it is released to the public. Examples of statistical information that is sold to third parties or released to the public include means, variances, or higher moments, as well as proportions of the population that satisfy certain conditions. However, we instead assume that we want to share the whole probability distribution, in the form of a density, without compromising the users’ privacy. This leads us to the problem of density estimation, which is the second pillar of this project. Indeed, this project aims to combine these two lines of research to obtain a differentially private density estimator that is easily implemented using a neural network.},

	Title = {Automated rodent sleep analysis with modern machine learning methods},
	Year = {2018},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-229398},
	Abstract = {Sleep staging is the use of electrophysiological signals to determine the quality and architecture of sleep in an animal. Currently, to achieve this, researchers manually classify contiguous sections of electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals into defined sleep modes or stages. This is a slow and laborious process. Many attempts at semi-automated solutions can be found in the literature. In these attempts, a researcher manually classifies a portion of the data from a specific rodent. This data is used to train a model which can then be used to classify the rest of the data from that rodent. While such solutions can be found in commercial products, they still require hours of manual classification to be done by the researcher. In this thesis, I explore two machine learning methods in an attempt to fully automate the process of sleep staging. The automation consists of building a classifier that can classify data from a new rodent, using only manually classified data from previous rodents. This classifier should classify this new rodent’s data at a sufficiently high accuracy. While there have also been attempts at such a system in the past, none of them have reached a level of accuracy that is acceptable for use. The two methods implemented in this thesis are support vector machines (SVM) and convolution neural networks (CNN). The results obtained are promising, with the results from SVM being on the cusp of real world usability for automated sleep staging.},

	Year = {2019},
	Type = {Bachelor's Thesis},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-254258},
	Abstract = {We propose two different methods for image segmentation with the objective of marking contaminated regions in images from biochemical tests. The contaminated regions consists of thin hair or fibers and the purpose of this thesis is to eliminate the tedious task of masking the contaminated regions by hand by implementing automatic hair masking. Initially an algorithm based on Morphological Image Processing is presented, followed by solving the problem of pixelwise classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the performance of each implementation is measured by comparing the segmented images with labelled images which are considered to be the ground truth. The result shows that both implementations have strong potential at successfully performing semantic segmentation on the images from the biochemical tests.},

        Abstract = {The aim of this project is to design an algorithm that identifies the Area of Interest (AOI) in ELISpot and FluoroSpot images. ELISpot and FluoroSpot are two varieties of a biochemical test used to analyze immune responses by quantifying the amount of cytokine secreted by cells. ELISpot and FluoroSpot images show a well that contains the cytokinesecreting cells which appear as scattered spots. Prior to counting the number of spots, it is required to detect the area in which to count the spots, i.e. the area delimited by the contour of the well. We propose to use the Circle Hough Transform together with filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detector in order to accurately detect such area. Furthermore we develop an outlier removal method that contributes to increase the robustness of the proposed detection method. Finally we compare our algorithm with another algorithm already in use. A Swedish biotech company called Mabtech has implemented an AOI identifier in the same field. Our proposed algorithm proves to be more robust and provides consistent results for all the images in the dataset.},

        Abstract = {Health is a fundamental human right. To increase global health, research in the medical sector is of great importance. Decreasing time consumption of biomedical testing could accelerate the research and development of new drugs and vaccines. This could be achieved by automation of biomedical analysis, using computerized methods. In order to perform analysis on pictures of biomedical tests, it is important to identify the area of interest (AOI) of the test. For example, cells and bacteria are commonly grown in petri dishes, in this case the AOI is the bottom area of the dish, since this is where the object of analysis is located.This study was performed with the aim to compare a few computerized methods for identifying the AOI in pictures of biomedical tests. In the study, biomedical images from a testing method called ELISpot have been used. ELISpot uses plates with up to 96 circular wells, where pictures of the separate wells were used in order to find the AOI corresponding to the bottom area of each well. The focus has been on comparing the performance of three edge detection methods. More specifically, their ability to accurately detect the edges of the well. Furthermore, a method for identifying a circle based on the detected edges was used to specify the AOI.The study shows that methods using second order derivatives for edge detection, gives the best results regarding to robustness.},

	Abstract = {Sleep scoring is the process that medical researchers use to analyze the sleep of a subject. By looking at signals in the brain and muscles, it is possible to determine the current sleep state of the subject. The procedure is traditionally done manually, requiring a lot of tedious processing of data. In this report, a machine learning system that automates the process of sleep scoring is studied and developed. The system works by estimating the power spectral density of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals, and training an artificial neural network to classify the correct sleep state. The signal processing was done in Python and the artificial neural network was implemented in Keras, using a TensorFlow back end. Finally, the implemented system proved to have an accuracy comparable to that of manual sleep scoring on five different rat datasets. Additionally, the system was able to generalize beyond the rat specimens it was trained on, meaning it could potentially be used on specimens that lack labeled sample data. },

	Abstract = {In today’s society, Artifical Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most controversial research topics. The Artifical Neural Network (ANN) is a form of AI designed to mimic the human brain and is typically used for pattern recognition. This is especially useful within the medical field where ANN:s have already been implemented in a variety of applications. This project focuses on the possibility of extending the use of ANN:s to also be used to facilitate diagnosing sleep disorders, by investigating how well they can classify sleep states in rats. Two different types of network architectures were considered in this project: one fed with information from one single sleep state, and one fed with information from multiple consecutive sleep states. The highest classification accuracy achieved by the networks were 96.78 \% and 97.02 \% respectively. The networks were fed with features extracted from the provided Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) data of the rats. This enabled a reduction of the complexity of the ANNs, which resulted in low training times. It was concluded that feeding the network with extracted features from the data was a good approach, and that a network with access to information about several sleep states classified with the best accuracy.},

	Year = {2018},
	Type = {Bachelor's Thesis},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-230738},
	Abstract = {The purpose of this project was to implement an inverse diffusion algorithm to locate the sources of an emitted substance. This algorithm has yielded successful results when applied to biological cell detection, and it has been suggested that the run time could be greatly reduced if adaptions for a computation graph framework are made. This would automate calculations of gradients and allow for faster execution on a graphics processing unit. The algorithm implementation was realized in TensorFlow, which is primarily a machine learning oriented programming library. Computer-generated biological test images were then used to evaluate the performance using regular image analysis software and accuracy metrics. Comparisons reveal that the TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm can match the accuracy metrics of traditional implementations of the same algorithm. Viewed in a broader scope this serves as an example to highlight the possibility of using computation graph frameworks to solve large scale optimization problems, and more specifically inverse problems.},

	Title = {Inverse diffusion by proximal optimization with {TensorFlow} [{P}roject: {L}arge scale optimization on a {GPU}]},
	Year = {2018},
	Type = {Bachelor's Thesis},
	Abstract = {We present a method for implementing a large scale, proximal optimization algorithm in a machine learning framework to solve an inverse problem. The algorithm is based on a previously developed method for analyzing data of some image-based immunoassays in the context of detecting diffused cells. By employing TensorFlow through it’s Python API, parallelized computations on graphical processing units, distributed processing, automatic gradient computation and computational efficiency are made available for implementation. Image processing methods are also utilized throughout the implementation, resulting in a F1-score of 0.91. The performance matches previous implementations of the algorithm presented, leading to the conclusion that the TensorFlow platform is well suited and provides advantages over traditional methods. We conclude that the method presented coupled with the resulting performance is a proof of concept, by providing an example of implementing convex optimization in a machine learning framework.},
