          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> University computer laboratories as we knew them are dead. The widespread availability of networked computing resources among students (smartphones, tablets, and laptops), combined with the existence of enabling technologies like Jupyter, can no longer be ignored when allocating resources for higher education in STEM. For us at the EPFL's Biomedical Imaging Group (Prof. Michael Unser), this realisation sinked in just months before the pandemic unraveled and effectively rendered the traditional format impossible. Since then, we have been simultaneously developing and running the graded laboratory sessions for our popular basic and advanced image-processing (IP) courses (up to 280 students) as online experiences on an institute-wide JupyterLab instance (Noto at EPFL). The students become experts in the implementation and application of concepts like image wavelet transforms, morphological operators, interpolation, and neural networks for pixel classifications, and do so working at their own pace and anytime. This has resulted in excellent feedback from students and teaching assistants alike.

          In this presentation, I will outline the pedagogical goals, technical work and results of this project. Among others, this will cover the development of polyglot notebooks (JavaScript + Python, harnessing the SoS framework) and a dedicated image processing JavaScript library to enable care-free realistic pixel-by-pixel IP algorithm development, the design of an interactive image viewer for Jupyter Notebooks (harnessing ipywidgets and Matplotlib), the development of a grading library for image and signal processing exercises with plagiarism detection (relying on the nbgrader framework), and our analysis of the student feedback to date.

          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> The impact of biomedical imaging has increased steadily over the past four decades. Part of this is due to the improvement of reconstruction methods, which have provided increasing image quality and resolution. In this tutorial, we present a well-structured view of the field of biomedical image reconstruction based on the few basic building blocks of any imaging system and the three generations of available methods, i.e., classical, sparsity-based, and deep neural networks techniques. For any given imaging problem, attendants will learn to quickly identify its fundamental building blocks from an inverse-problems perspective and propose adequate methodology. Furthermore, we will introduce how to obtain fast prototypes of reconstruction techniques using GlobalBioIm, an efficient MATLAB library tailored to image reconstruction problems.

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical imaging plays a key role in medicine and biology. Its range of applications and its impact in research and medical practice have increased steadily during the past 4 decades. Part of the astonishing improvements in image quality and resolution is due to the use of increasingly sophisticated signal-processing techniques. This, in itself, would justify the tutorial. Nonetheless, the field is now transitioning towards the deep-learning era, where disruptive improvements and lack of theoretical background go hand-in-hand. To harness the power of these new techniques without suffering from their pitfalls, a structured understanding of the field is fundamental.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> We start the tutorial by presenting the building blocks of an image-reconstruction problem, from the underlying image that lives in function spaces to its observed discrete measurements. Most importantly, we detail the small collection of forward and sampling operators that allow one to model most biomedical imaging problems, including magnetic resonance imaging, bright-field microscopy, structured-illumination microscopy, x-ray computed tomography, and optical diffraction tomography. This leads up to our exposition of 1st-generation methods (e.g., filtered back-projection, Tikhonov regularization), the regimes in which they are most attractive, and how to implement them efficiently. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> We then transition to 2nd-generation methods (non-quadratic regularization, sparsity, and compressive sensing) and show how advanced signal processing allows image reconstruction with smaller acquisition times, less invasive procedures, and lower radioactive and irradiation dosage. We expose the foundations of these methods (results in compressed-sensing recovery, representer theorems, infinite-divisible distributions) and the most useful algorithms in imaging (proximal operators, projected gradient descent, alternate-direction method of multipliers), again exemplifying their efficient implementation.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> Finally, we present the state of the art in 3rd-generation methods (deep-learning reconstruction of images), categorizing them using the building-block terminology introduced throughout the tutorial. In this manner, we emphasize the links to 1st- and 2nd-generation methods in order to provide intuition and guidelines to devise and understand novel 3rd-generation methods. Furthermore, we state the benefits of each proposal and give cautionary examples of the dangers of overreliance on training data. </p>

In this paper, we study the use of time-to-digital converters in wireless sensors, which provides clock synchronization and ranging at negligible communication overhead through a sawtooth signal model for round trip times. In particular, we derive Cramér-Rao lower bounds for a linearitzation of the sawtooth signal model, and we thoroughly evaluate simple estimation techniques by simulation, giving clear and concise performance references for this technology. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISpot and FluoroSpot immunoassays is a challenging task. Methodology recently proposed by our group matches human accuracy by leveraging knowledge of the underlying physical process of these assays and using state-of-the-art iterative techniques to solve an inverse problem. Nonetheless, thousands of computationally expensive iterations are often needed to reach a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the iterations to design a parameterized computation graph, <i>SpotNet</i>, that learns the characteristic patterns embedded within several training images and their respective cell secretion information. Further, we compare SpotNet to a customized convolutional neural network layout for cell detection based on recent advances. We show empirical evidence that, while both designs obtain a detection performance far beyond that of a human expert, SpotNet is substantially easier to train and obtains better estimates of cell secretion. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISPOT and Fluorospot immunoassays is considered a bottleneck. The task has remained hard to automatize, and biomedical researchers often have to rely on results that are not accurate. Previously proposed solutions are heuristic, and data-based solutions are subject to a lack of objective ground truth data. In this paper, we analyze a partial differential equations model for ELISPOT, Fluorospot, and assays of similar design. This leads us to a mathematical observation model for the images generated by these assays. We use this model to motivate a methodology for cell detection. Finally, we provide a real-data example that suggests that this cell detection methodology and a human expert perform comparably.</p>

Then, I will present our proposal to invert this observation model through a functional optimization problem with group-sparsity regularization and explain the reasoning behind this choice of regularizer. I will also present the results needed to derive the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for this problem, and justify why we chose to formulate the algorithm in the original function spaces where our observation model operates.
