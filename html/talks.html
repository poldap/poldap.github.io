          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> University computer laboratories as we knew them are dead. The widespread availability of networked computing resources among students (smartphones, tablets, and laptops), combined with the existence of enabling technologies like Jupyter, can no longer be ignored when allocating resources for higher education in STEM. For us at the EPFL's Biomedical Imaging Group (Prof. Michael Unser), this realisation sinked in just months before the pandemic unraveled and effectively rendered the traditional format impossible. Since then, we have been simultaneously developing and running the graded laboratory sessions for our popular basic and advanced image-processing (IP) courses (up to 280 students) as online experiences on an institute-wide JupyterLab instance (Noto at EPFL). The students become experts in the implementation and application of concepts like image wavelet transforms, morphological operators, interpolation, and neural networks for pixel classifications, and do so working at their own pace and anytime. This has resulted in excellent feedback from students and teaching assistants alike.

          In this presentation, I will outline the pedagogical goals, technical work and results of this project. Among others, this will cover the development of polyglot notebooks (JavaScript + Python, harnessing the SoS framework) and a dedicated image processing JavaScript library to enable care-free realistic pixel-by-pixel IP algorithm development, the design of an interactive image viewer for Jupyter Notebooks (harnessing ipywidgets and Matplotlib), the development of a grading library for image and signal processing exercises with plagiarism detection (relying on the nbgrader framework), and our analysis of the student feedback to date.

          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> The impact of biomedical imaging has increased steadily over the past four decades. Part of this is due to the improvement of reconstruction methods, which have provided increasing image quality and resolution. In this tutorial, we present a well-structured view of the field of biomedical image reconstruction based on the few basic building blocks of any imaging system and the three generations of available methods, i.e., classical, sparsity-based, and deep neural networks techniques. For any given imaging problem, attendants will learn to quickly identify its fundamental building blocks from an inverse-problems perspective and propose adequate methodology. Furthermore, we will introduce how to obtain fast prototypes of reconstruction techniques using GlobalBioIm, an efficient MATLAB library tailored to image reconstruction problems.

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical imaging plays a key role in medicine and biology. Its range of applications and its impact in research and medical practice have increased steadily during the past 4 decades. Part of the astonishing improvements in image quality and resolution is due to the use of increasingly sophisticated signal-processing techniques. This, in itself, would justify the tutorial. Nonetheless, the field is now transitioning towards the deep-learning era, where disruptive improvements and lack of theoretical background go hand-in-hand. To harness the power of these new techniques without suffering from their pitfalls, a structured understanding of the field is fundamental.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> We start the tutorial by presenting the building blocks of an image-reconstruction problem, from the underlying image that lives in function spaces to its observed discrete measurements. Most importantly, we detail the small collection of forward and sampling operators that allow one to model most biomedical imaging problems, including magnetic resonance imaging, bright-field microscopy, structured-illumination microscopy, x-ray computed tomography, and optical diffraction tomography. This leads up to our exposition of 1st-generation methods (e.g., filtered back-projection, Tikhonov regularization), the regimes in which they are most attractive, and how to implement them efficiently. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> We then transition to 2nd-generation methods (non-quadratic regularization, sparsity, and compressive sensing) and show how advanced signal processing allows image reconstruction with smaller acquisition times, less invasive procedures, and lower radioactive and irradiation dosage. We expose the foundations of these methods (results in compressed-sensing recovery, representer theorems, infinite-divisible distributions) and the most useful algorithms in imaging (proximal operators, projected gradient descent, alternate-direction method of multipliers), again exemplifying their efficient implementation.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> Finally, we present the state of the art in 3rd-generation methods (deep-learning reconstruction of images), categorizing them using the building-block terminology introduced throughout the tutorial. In this manner, we emphasize the links to 1st- and 2nd-generation methods in order to provide intuition and guidelines to devise and understand novel 3rd-generation methods. Furthermore, we state the benefits of each proposal and give cautionary examples of the dangers of overreliance on training data. </p>

Their importance to medical imaging cannot be overstated. We review the known results for the topical variational regularization strategies (ℓ₂ and ℓ₁ regularization) and present novel stability results for ℓₚ-regularized linear inverse problems for p∈(1,∞). Our results guarantee Lipschitz continuity for small p and Hölder continuity for larger p. They generalize well to the Lₚ(Ω) function spaces. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> A logconcave likelihood is as important to proper statistical inference as a convex cost function is important to variational optimization. Quantization is often disregarded when writing likelihood models, ignoring the limitations of the physical detectors used to collect the data. These two facts call for the question: would including quantization in likelihood models preclude logconcavity? are the true data likelihoods logconcave? We provide a general proof that the same simple assumption that leads to logconcave continuous-data likelihoods also leads to logconcave quantized-data likelihoods, provided that convex quantization regions are used. </p>

In this paper, we focus on Riesz bases and propose a projection operator that, in contrast to previous works, guarantees the bona fide properties for the estimate, namely, non-negativity and total probability mass 1. Our bona fide projection is defined as a convex problem. We propose solution techniques and evaluate them. Results suggest an improved performance, specifically in circumstances prone to rippling effects. </p>

Methodology recently proposed by our group matches human accuracy by leveraging knowledge of the underlying physical process of these assays and using state-of-the-art iterative techniques to solve an inverse problem. Nonetheless, thousands of computationally expensive iterations are often needed to reach a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the iterations to design a parameterized computation graph, <i>SpotNet</i>, that learns the characteristic patterns embedded within several training images and their respective cell secretion information. Further, we compare SpotNet to a customized convolutional neural network layout for cell detection based on recent advances. We show empirical evidence that, while both designs obtain a detection performance far beyond that of a human expert, SpotNet is substantially easier to train and obtains better estimates of cell secretion. </p>

The task has remained hard to automatize, and biomedical researchers often have to rely on results that are not accurate.

In this paper, we analyze a partial differential equations model for ELISPOT, Fluorospot, and assays of similar design. This leads us to a mathematical observation model for the images generated by these assays. We use this model to motivate a methodology for cell detection.

Then, I will present our proposal to invert this observation model through a functional optimization problem with group-sparsity regularization and explain the reasoning behind this choice of regularizer. I will also present the results needed to derive the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for this problem, and justify why we chose to formulate the algorithm in the original function spaces where our observation model operates.

          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Algorithms to solve inverse problems are at the core of imaging, wheere they are known
            as image reconstruction methods. These methods recover the desired images from the indirect measurements provided by physical measurement devices
            such as PET, MRI or EEG systems. Medical imaging critically depends on the guarantees these methods provide to inform diagnostic and treatment decisions.
            Of specific relevance is how stable they are--how much the recovered image changes when the measurements change slightly. In this talk, I will first
            briefly present a unified understanding of the history of image reconstruction. Then, I will clearly lay out the stability guarantees
            provided by different modern image reconstruction methos, focusing on our own work on the stability of Lp-regularization strategies.

          <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Most image reconstruction methods across biomedical imaging rely on
            the successful formalism of imaging as an inverse problem. In this framework, and imaging system is represented as a transformation
            of a continuous quantity (e.g., a density of fluorophores over a certain plane or volume) into a number of measurements. Image
            reconstruction is then understood as the recovery of the original continuous quantity. The successful design of reconstruction methods
            following this paradigm involves both advanced mathematics to reliably incorporate prior knowledge and major efforts to develop
            efficient algorithms. In this talk, I explain the basic concepts of the field and show how our library "GlobalBioIm" can facilitate
            your research, with a couple of running examples to showcase its different functionalities.
