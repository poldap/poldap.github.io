<h4>Academic degrees and employment</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    In September 2019, I obtained a <i>Teknologie doktorsexamen inom elektro-
    och systemteknik</i> (Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute
    of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). Before that, I obtained a double 5-year
    engineering degree, <i>Enginyer de Telecomunicació</i> (Telecommunications
    Engineering, UPC BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Catalonia) and <i>Civilingejör
    inom Elektroteknik</i> (Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of
    Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). Since October 2019, I am a research staff
    scientist at the CIBM Center for Biomedical Imaging, Switzerland, and a
    postdoctoral researcher at the EPFL's Biomedical Imaging Group, Lausanne,

    I am an <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/454468">
    active reviewer </a> in my fields of interest.
    During my time at EPFL, I have been awarded CHF 44'000 to lead a project on
    innovative solutions for remote practical learning.
    During my Ph.D., I was awarded a number of travel grants amounting to
    a total of 64'200 SEK. Among others, these grants included the Åforsk
    Foundation travel grant and the KVA Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
    Engineering Sciences grant. Their intent was to support the international
    promotion of my research in inverse problems in imaging, as well as
    research visits to Stephen Boyd's research group at the Information Systems
    Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University and to
    CosmoStat, Jean-Luc Starck's group in CEA Paris-Saclay.
